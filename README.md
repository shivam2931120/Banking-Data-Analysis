# üè¶ Banking Data Analysis (EDA with Python)
üìå Project Overview:
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a banking dataset to understand customer demographics, financial behavior, and factors influencing term deposit subscriptions.
The analysis focuses on uncovering insights related to age, job type, balance, education, loans, contact type, and campaign success.

üéØ Objectives:
Explore and summarize the dataset structure.
Identify data distributions and outliers.
Analyze customer demographics such as age, job, marital status, education.
Study financial indicators like balance, loan, housing loan.
Visualize key relationships between numerical variables.
Generate a correlation heatmap to identify patterns.

üß∞ Technologies Used:
Python 3.x
Pandas ‚Äì Data manipulation and analysis
NumPy ‚Äì Numerical computations
Matplotlib ‚Äì Data visualization
Seaborn ‚Äì Statistical data visualization

üìÇ Dataset:
The dataset used in this project is stored as banking_data.csv.
It contains information about bank clients, their demographics, financial data, and whether they subscribed to a term deposit.

| `duration`       | Duration of last contact (in seconds)                 |
| `poutcome`       | Outcome of the previous marketing campaign            |
| `y`              | Has the client subscribed to a term deposit? (yes/no) |

üìä Analysis Performed

Univariate Analysis:
Frequency distributions and unique value counts for each column.
Box plot and count plot for age.
Value counts for categorical variables (job, education, marital_status, etc.).

Bivariate Analysis:
Correlation matrix and heatmap for numerical columns.
Comparison between financial and demographic factors.

Key Insights:
Distribution of client age groups.
